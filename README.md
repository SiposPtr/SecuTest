# 🔐 SecuTest

**SecuTest** is a security-focused iOS project designed for learning, experimenting, and pushing the limits of jailbreak detection and mobile app protection.

> 🧪 Built by a curious pentester who loves to break (and fix) things.

## 🧭 Project Goals

1. **🔍 Demonstrate iOSSecuritySuite in action**  
   Build a demo app that runs and displays various iOSSecuritySuite checks (e.g., jailbreak detection, reverse engineering protection, etc.) so users can **visually test** whether their device is secure or tampered with.

2. **💥 Bypass Protections**  
   Use **Frida**, **custom tweaks**, and other tools to try and bypass the security checks, then **document the process** for research and education.

3. **🛠️ Fork & Modify**  
   Create a custom fork of [`iOSSecuritySuite`](https://github.com/SiposPtr/IOSSecuritySuite) that can be tweaked to:
   - Add logging for better understanding
   - Investigate how it works under the hood
   - Experiment with detection evasion and patching

## 📦 Tech Stack

- Frida
- Custom jailbreak tweaks

## 👨‍💻 For Pentesters, Students, and Curious Hackers

SecuTest isn't meant for bypassing protections in production apps — it's a playground to:
- Understand mobile protections
- Learn how tools like Frida work
- See how jailbreak detection is actually implemented
- Practice evasion techniques **ethically**

## 🚧 Disclaimer

This project is for **educational and ethical hacking** purposes only. Don’t use it to bypass security in apps you don’t own or have permission to test.
Also this project is built to enhance my resume, so its very much a **WIP** project, but wuld love to make it neat. :)
